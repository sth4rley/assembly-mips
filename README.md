# Assembly MIPS

A repository for my MIPS assembly language studies in the course of Computer Organization and Architecture I.

MIPS (Microprocessor without interlocked pipeline stages) is a RISC microprocessor architecture. The MIPS assembly language is used to program these microprocessors, providing simple instructions and gaining popularity in embedded systems and compilers.
